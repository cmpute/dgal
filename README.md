# DGAL
Differentiable Geometry Algorithms Library. This library provide differentiable implementations of computational geometry problems like polygon intersection. The library is header-only and written in C++. A simple Python binding is also provided. To build the binding please use CMake.

# Reference
Please considering citing the library if you find the library useful in your work :)
